These are the scripts that I use for my Arch Linux configuration.
Each script will have a Dependency and Info section. The Dependency section
explains what is required for it to run smoothly if you decide to implement
something similar or want to use it, and the info section describes what the script does.

- dmenu/

  	Scripts for dmenu interaction
- notify/

	purely notifies that an event has happened meaning it doesn't change state
- state_changes/

	Scripts for changing something like brightness or audio levels. These will
	change something in the system. Although these can have notificaitons.
- statusbar/

	Scripts for displaying in the statusbar. These scripts only read state and don't change it
